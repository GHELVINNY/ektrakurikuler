# DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION
## USE CASE DIAGRAM
- Use case diagrams can be used to explain scenarios or descriptions of system use and their interactions with processes or functions that exist in the system. It reveals what the system needs to do, but doesn't go into implementation details like data structures and algorithms. In other words, it reveals who is actually using the system to be built
- The use case diagrams designed in this study are as follows:

Figure 1. Use Case Diagram of Extracurricular Management Information System at CS50's School
- In the description of the use case diagram above, it can be seen that in the proposed system there will be 3 (three) users, namely: students, administrators and teachers as coaches. 

While the main processes in this system will be grouped into 5 (five) processes, namely registration, login, dashboard, extracurricular management and reports. The scenario of the existing system in the use case diagram is as follows:
1. Student users must register with the system first to get an account to see the activities and types of extracurriculars available.

2. After registering and verifying, the student then logs in using the account that was previously registered.
4. If the username and password are valid, the student will then be displayed on the dashboard menu for students.

5. Students can also see the activities and types of extracurricular activities at CS50's School

7. Students can also view reports on the progress of extracurricular activities that have been running.
8. Managers and supervisors must also log in first to access extracurricular activities.

10. After logging in, you can only manage extracurricular activities and view reports from extracurricular activities according to the section.

2. Database
In database design, the first thing to do is to determine the entities associated with the system. Entity identification is the initial stage when designing a database, because an entity is something whose data will be stored and each entity also has attributes. 
The database design in the extracurricular management information system at CS50's School is as follows
